            /// * ```shutterFail``` - Open or close of the shutter failed due to manipulation or hardware error.
            /// * ```mediaJammed``` - The media is jammed.
            /// * ```refusedItems``` - Programming error: refused items that must be returned via the [Check.PresentMedia](#check.presentmedia) command have not been presented (see [presentRequired](#check.mediarefusedevent.event.description.presentrequired)).
            /// * ```allBinsFull``` - All storage units are unusable due to being full, missing or inoperative, so no further items can be accepted.
            /// * ```scannerInop``` - Only images were requested by the application and these cannot be obtained because the image scanner is inoperative.
            /// * ```micrInop``` - Only MICR data was requested by the application and it cannot be obtained because the MICR reader is inoperative.
            /// * ```positionNotEmpty``` - One of the input/output/refused positions is not empty and items cannot be inserted until the media items in the position are removed.
            /// * ```feederNotEmpty``` - The media feeder is not empty. This only applies when the [Check.GetNextItem](#check.getnextitem) command should be used to retrieve the next media item.
            /// * ```mediaRejected``` - The media was rejected before it was fully inserted within the device. The [Check.MediaRejectedEvent](#check.mediarejectedevent) is posted with the details. The device is still operational.
            /// * ```feederInop``` - The media feeder is inoperative.
            /// * ```mediaPresent``` - Media from a previous transaction is present in the device when an attempt to start a new media-in transaction was made. The media must be cleared before a new transaction can be started.
