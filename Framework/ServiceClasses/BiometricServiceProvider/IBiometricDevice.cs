        /// This command enables the device for biometric scanning, then captures and optionally returns biometric data. A [Biometric.PresentSubjectEvent](#biometric.presentsubjectevent) will be sent to notify the client when it is ready to begin scanning and a [Biometric.SubjectDetectedEvent](#biometric.subjectdetectedevent) sent for each scanning attempt. The *numCaptures* input parameter specifies how many captures should be attempted, unless it is zero in which case the device itself will determine this. Once this command has successfully captured biometric raw data it will complete with Success.The [Biometric.Read](#biometric.read) command has two purposes:**Scanning**: The biometric data that is captured into the device can be processed into biometric template data and returned as an output parameter for enrollment or storage elsewhere, e.g. on a server or smart card.**Matching**: The biometric data that is captured into the device can be used for subsequent matching. Once data has been scanned into the device it can be compared to existing biometric templates that have been imported using the [Biometric.Import](#biometric.import) in order to allow verification or identification of an individual. The [matchSupported](#common.capabilities.completion.properties.biometric.matchsupported) capability indicates if the [Biometric.Match](#biometric.match) can be used for matching, otherwise the matching must be done externally, e.g. on a server or smart card. In either case the data that has been scanned into the device will be persistent according to the current persistence mode as reported by the *dataPersistence* status property.

        /// This command imports a list of biometric template data structures into the device for later comparison with biometric datascanned using the [Biometric.Read](#biometric.read). Normally this data is read from the chip on a customerâ€™s card or provided by the host system. Data that has been imported is available until a [Biometric.Clear](#biometric.clear) is called. If template data has been previously imported using a call to [Biometric.Import](#biometric.import), then it is overwritten. This data is not persistent across power fails.

For all other devices [unsupportedCommand](#api.messagetypes.completionmessages.completioncodes) will be returned here.If the capability *[matchSupported](#common.capabilities.completion.properties.biometric.matchsupported)* == combinedMatch then this command is mandatory. If it is not called first, the [Biometric.Match](#biometric.match) will fail with the generic error [sequenceError](#api.messagetypes.completionmessages.completioncodes).
