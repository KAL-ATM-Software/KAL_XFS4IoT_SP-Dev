            ///   been removed.
            /// * ```flushFail``` - The device was not able to flush data.
            /// * ```retractBinFull``` - The retract bin is full. No more media can be retracted. The current media is
            ///   still in the device.
            /// * ```stackerFull``` - The internal stacker is full. No more media can be moved to the stacker.
            /// * ```pageTurnFail``` - The device was not able to turn the page.
            /// * ```mediaTurnFail``` - The device was not able to turn the inserted media.
            /// * ```shutterFail``` - Open or close of the shutter failed due to manipulation or hardware error.
            /// * ```mediaJammed``` - The media is jammed; operator intervention is required.
            /// * ```paperJammed``` - The paper is jammed.
            /// * ```paperOut``` - The paper supply is empty.
            /// * ```inkOut``` - No stamping possible, stamping ink supply empty.
            /// * ```tonerOut``` - Toner or ink supply is empty or printing contrast with ribbon is not sufficient.
            /// * ```sequenceInvalid``` - Programming error. Invalid command sequence (e.g. *park* and the parking
            ///   station is busy).
            /// * ```mediaRetained``` - Media has been retracted in attempts to eject it. The device is clear and can
            ///   be used.
            /// * ```blackMark``` - Black mark detection has failed, nothing has been printed.
            /// * ```mediaRetracted``` - Presented media was automatically retracted before all wads could be
            ///   presented and before the command could complete successfully.
